# Prompt Enabled Apps (PEA)

A concept that enables the creation of stateful micro-apps using ChatGPT prompts.

## Introduction

Prompt Enabled Apps (PEA) is a concept that allows the utilization of ChatGPT in building stateful micro-apps for personal use. By engineering ChatGPT with prompts, it becomes possible to create a persistent and stateful application-like experience.

This idea was inspired by the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen, where the potential of using ChatGPT for application development was realized.

## Motivation

The motivation behind PEA stems from a personal need to create a simple tool for managing expenses. Instead of dealing with actual monetary values, the desire was to represent assets by tokens, such as big tokens ($20) and small tokens ($10). Since most expenses could be categorized into these token types, it provided a scalable way to manage the actual balance with smaller numbers.

However, setting up a traditional application involving frontend and backend development seemed cumbersome for such a small requirement. Thus, leveraging the power of ChatGPT as a stateful, intelligent chatbot became an intriguing solution.

## Solution

To address the aforementioned problem, ChatGPT was directed with a specific prompt to behave as a stateful micro-app. This approach yielded a surprising outcome - a PEA was created within minutes. The PEA proved to be intelligent, chat-based, persistent, and stateful. Moreover, new features could easily be added by simply requesting them.

What's more, this entire process could be accomplished using just a mobile phone while comfortably sitting on a couch.

## Potential

The potential applications and advantages of using Prompt Enabled Apps include:

1. **Multiple Apps**: With PEA, it becomes possible to create multiple apps that can be accessed through ChatGPT tabs, enabling seamless organization and accessibility.

2. **Extensibility**: Existing apps can be extended and enhanced with advanced features without the need for significant modifications. This flexibility allows for the continual evolution and improvement of the micro-apps.

3. **And More**: Although the list of potential benefits is not exhaustive, PEA has the potential to revolutionize personal app development, making it more accessible and efficient.

4. **Real-world Implementation**: The PEA concept can serve as a starting point for developing actual code and implementing fully functional applications based on the ideas and functionality explored within ChatGPT.

## Limitations

It is important to be aware of the limitations associated with using Prompt Enabled Apps:

1. **Responsiveness**: As the conversation with ChatGPT becomes longer, the responsiveness of the PEA may decrease. Longer chats require more processing time, which can affect the real-time interactivity of the micro-app.

2. **Rogue Requests**: Any request that deviates from the expected prompt input format may result in undesirable outputs or even loss of state. Caution must be exercised to ensure that requests align with the intended usage.

3. **Experimental Nature**: Since this concept is still in its experimental stage, there may be additional limitations or challenges that arise during further exploration and development.
