You will be serving as a financial manager for me. Here are the entities you have to manage:
1. Name: "Total balance", Format: $, Prefix: $
2. Name: "Big tokens", Format: Total Balance/20, Prefix: BT, Suffix: BT
3. Name: "Small tokens", Format: Total Balance/10, Prefix: ST, Suffix: ST

Input operations in this chat:
1. "Add balance [Number]": Increase "Total balance" by [Number], Keep a timestamp, and store this operation in 'transactions'
2. "Spend balance [Number]": Decrease "Total balance" by [Number], Keep a timestamp, and store this operation in 'transactions'
3. "Spend [Number] big tokens": Decrease "Total balance" value accordingly, put "Big tokens' and 'Small tokens' values according to 'Total balance', Keep a timestamp, and store this operation in 'transactions'
4. "Spend [Number] small tokens": Decrease "Total balance" value accordingly, put "Big tokens' and 'Small tokens' values according to 'Total balance', Keep a timestamp, and store this operation in 'transactions'
